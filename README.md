# Analysis of Video game console sales:

*Console sales data show a pattern of the most popular and least popular consoles worldwide. It also shows the most profitable countries and the most popular consoles. The data I will analyze and compare is based on console sales data from North America, Europe & Africa, Asia & other (not including Africa, Europe, or North America) countries, and Global sales. Additionally, I will analyze Critic Scores for the video game consoles, the critic scores are calculated from the sum of all reviews for each console.*

Starting with **North America**, the region shows the **highest sales**. Data shows that North America has a big market when it comes to video game consoles, this big market gets highlighted when comparing North American sales with the other places. When compared to console sales for other countries North America's lowest-selling console, the XOne (23 million units), outperforms Europe & Africa's 6th highest, the PSP (21.8 million), and Asia & Other's 5th highest, the PSP (12.82 million).

The region with the **lowest console sales** is **Asia & other countries**, the numbers show that Asia & other countries have the smallest market for video game consoles, this may come as a surprise considering that Asia alone has a bigger population compared to North America. Despite this, Asia & Other still has the smallest market for consoles.

The least sold console globally is the **XOne**, which **ranks lowest** in every region and has the lowest critic score. This suggests that the XOne is the least profitable console.
The **top-selling** console globally is the **PS3** (451.7 million units), followed by the X360 (431.3 million units). Even though the PS3 sold more units, the **X360 has a higher critic score** (2216), compared to the PS3’s 2091. This data shows that while PS3 is the most profitable console globally, according to critics X360 is better quality based on Hardware & Performance, Game Library & Exclusives, User Experience, Features & Services, and Price & Value. This could be important information for developers and companies to pay attention to. Developers should not only focus on sales but should also **consider user feedback** and pay attention to all the qualities that make X360 a favorite and try to apply that to other consoles. Applying these strengths to future consoles could improve sales. 

Data shows that the regions with the most **similar console sales trends** are Europe & Africa and Asia & other Countries. Both have the PS3 as the best-selling console, the X360 in 2nd place, and the XOne with the lowest sales. They also both have PS4 in 3rd place, PS2 in 4th and they both have DS in 8th and XOne in 9th. This shows **similar tastes** in consoles across these regions and can inform **marketing strategies**.

The most profitable region is North America, with **Europe & Africa** ranking second. Although the Europe & Africa regions have the second highest profitability, their **sales figures do not compare to North America’s**. For instance, the most popular console in Europe & Africa sold 174.4 million units, whereas North America’s top console reached 255.7 million sales, based on these numbers **North America is 46.62% more profitable than Europe & Africa**. This is significant because Europe and Africa have a combined population of 2 billion, while North America’s population is approximately 383 million. Theoretically, Europe & Africa should have a higher customer base but data shows that North America has a greater number of consumers willing to purchase consoles.
 Based on this information **Marketing** efforts should **focus more on Europe & Africa**, as these regions represent a huge **untapped market**. Based on the numbers of sales from North America, marketing has mastered appealing to the North American audience. If this marketing idea turns out to be successful it could easily beat North American sales by at least hundreds of millions of sales. This marketing approach could also be applied to Asia & Other Countries.

Conclusion: to boost sales, I recommend **expanding marketing efforts** in Europe, Africa, Asia, and other countries. This could reach billions of new customers, significantly increasing sales numbers dramatically. Additionally, **paying attention to critics' feedback** and incorporating the features they value into new consoles could enhance quality and improve market reception.
