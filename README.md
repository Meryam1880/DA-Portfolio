# Analysis of Video game console sales:

*Console sales data show a pattern of the most popular and least popular consoles worldwide. It also shows the most profitable countries and the most popular consoles. The data I will analyze and compare is based on console sales data from North America, Europe & Africa, Asia & other (not including Africa, Europe, or North America) countries, and Global sales. Additionally, I will analyze Critic Scores for the video game consoles, the critic scores are calculated from the sum of all reviews for each console.*

Starting with **North America**, the region shows the **highest sales**. Data shows that North America has a big market when it comes to video game consoles, this big market gets highlighted when comparing North American sales with the other places. When compared to console sales for other countries North America's lowest-selling console, the XOne (23 million units), outperforms Europe & Africa's 6th highest, the PSP (21.8 million), and Asia & Other's 5th highest, the PSP (12.82 million).

The region with the **lowest console sales** is **Asia & other countries**, the numbers show that Asia & other countries have the smallest market for video game consoles, this may come as a surprise considering that Asia alone has a bigger population compared to North America. Despite this, Asia & Other still has the smallest market for consoles.

The least sold console globally is the **XOne**, which **ranks lowest** in every region and has the lowest critic score. This suggests that the XOne is the least profitable console.
The **top-selling** console globally is the **PS3** (451.7 million units), followed by the X360 (431.3 million units). Even though the PS3 sold more units, the **X360 has a higher critic score** (2216), compared to the PS3’s 2091. This data shows that while PS3 is the most profitable console globally, according to critics X360 is better quality based on Hardware & Performance, Game Library & Exclusives, User Experience, Features & Services, and Price & Value. This could be important information for developers and companies to pay attention to. Developers should not only focus on sales but should also **consider user feedback** and pay attention to all the qualities that make X360 a favorite and try to apply that to other consoles. Applying these strengths to future consoles could improve sales. 

Data shows that the regions with the most **similar console sales trends** are Europe & Africa and Asia & other Countries. Both have the PS3 as the best-selling console, the X360 in 2nd place, and the XOne with the lowest sales. They also both have PS4 in 3rd place, PS2 in 4th and they both have DS in 8th and XOne in 9th. This shows **similar tastes** in consoles across these regions and can inform **marketing strategies**.

The most profitable region is North America, with **Europe & Africa** ranking second. Although the Europe & Africa regions have the second highest profitability, their **sales figures do not compare to North America’s**. For instance, the most popular console in Europe & Africa sold 174.4 million units, whereas North America’s top console reached 255.7 million sales, based on these numbers **North America is 46.62% more profitable than Europe & Africa**. This is significant because Europe and Africa have a combined population of 2 billion, while North America’s population is approximately 383 million. Theoretically, Europe & Africa should have a higher customer base but data shows that North America has a greater number of consumers willing to purchase consoles.
 Based on this information **Marketing** efforts should **focus more on Europe & Africa**, as these regions represent a huge **untapped market**. Based on the numbers of sales from North America, marketing has mastered appealing to the North American audience. If this marketing idea turns out to be successful it could easily beat North American sales by at least hundreds of millions of sales. This marketing approach could also be applied to Asia & Other Countries.

Conclusion: to boost sales, I recommend **expanding marketing efforts** in Europe, Africa, Asia, and other countries. This could reach billions of new customers, significantly increasing sales numbers dramatically. Additionally, **paying attention to critics' feedback** and incorporating the features they value into new consoles could enhance quality and improve market reception.

# Analysis of Video Game genres and developers:
*Video game genres and developers are important when it comes to the sales of products. Consumers are willing to buy more products of genres they enjoy and they are more willing to buy games from developers they trust to make high-quality games. In this analysis, I will examine video game data by genre and developer across North America, Europe & Africa, and Asia & other regions. Developers typically focus on one or two main genres, which can predict what users expect. Additionally, I will analyze critic scores for these genres*

Globally the **biggest video game developers** are **Infinity Ward** (104.62 million sales), 2nd place is EA Canada (92.51 million sales), and 3rd place is Rockstar North (90.93 million sales). These developers have created games that match what consumers want, leading to strong sales and profits.

**North America’s biggest developer** is **Infinity Ward** (55.25 million sales), 2nd biggest is Treyarch and 3rd biggest is Rockstar North. Based on the most popular developers in North America the **most popular genres** are Action, shooter, and role-playing. For example, North America's biggest developer Infinity Ward only sells the action shooter game “Call of Duty”. This data shows that North American users are looking for a particular type of games, this can be used when developing games that are targeted towards the North American audience. It can also be used to **promote genres** that are not as big in North America, this way we could reach **new audiences** that may not be interested in action-shooter games.

**EA Canada** is the largest game developer for Europe, Africa, Asia, and other regions. In these markets, Europe and Africa have sold a combined 58 million units, while Asia and other regions have sold 14.14 million units. This is notable because, despite North America being the biggest consumer market, EA Canada does not even rank among its top five largest developers. The reason why **EA Canada is not very popular in North America** is because they mostly make **sports games**, with soccer games being produced the most. This information gives us an insight into why EA Canada is not popular in North America. North American gamers tend to prefer action, shooter, and role-playing games over sports games. Additionally, soccer is not as popular in North America compared to other regions, which further limits EA Canada's appeal in this market. EA Canada’s success outside North America makes sense, seeing that soccer is very popular across the rest of the world.

The biggest genre based on **global sales** is Shooter games, 2nd biggest is Action and 3rd biggest is Sports. Even though Sports is the top genre in Europe, Africa, Asia, and other regions, North America's strong preference for Shooter and Action games results in higher sales for these genres. This highlights **North America's impact on global gaming trends**, as its purchasing power heavily influences which genres dominate overall sales.

Based on **Critics Action is the best genre**, role-playing is 2nd best, and shooter is 3rd best. Based on the scores, it is evident that **Sports** are **not very popular with critics**, I believe this is because sports games don't have much depth regarding story, plot, or characters and because of this it leaves critics generally unimpressed.

Conclusion: To boost sales **developers** should try to **make more genres** and try to **market** them to appeal **to different audiences**. Currently, many developers focus on a single successful genre for their target market. However, creating fresh, engaging content across multiple genres can attract a broader audience and boost sales. Market Story-driven games should be marketed more in Europe, Africa, Asia, and other regions, as they could offer new experiences and drive sales growth. Market more adventure and sports games to North American audiences. At the moment it seems that different regions are associated with only one or two dominant genres, which may be limiting overall profits. **Expanding genre marketing** can lead to greater success worldwide
